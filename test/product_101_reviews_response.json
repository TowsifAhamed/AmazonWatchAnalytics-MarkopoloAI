        "review_text": "I've had a Charles Hubert model 3571 for a couple years that I love, so I decided to try CH's mechanical watches. I chose the 3841-WR because it has a full dial instead of a skeleton dial; I didn't want the distraction of the gears when checking the time. I think I chose well-- the 3841 is an elegant, uncluttered, handsome watch. It has a nice, solid weight to it, and the action on the hunter cover works well. The crown and bow are at 3 o'clock, which allows me to hold it naturally, thumb it open and read the dial upright. Winding it at bedtime keeps it going through the night without an appreciable difference from my battery watches come morning. I wind it again in the morning, with a touch up about mid-day. I do wish there were a hack to stop the second hand so I could synchronize it more precisely with my other watches; as it is, the second hand starts counting the moment there's power in the mainspring. But I'm happy with my choice-- the 3841 is simple without being plain, and functions nicely.",
