                "review_text": "As my eyesight gets worse with age, I was looking for a durable, waterproof, easy-to-read watch with a simple timer that looked great on my wrist. I own both a Fitbit and Apple watch \u2013 I was getting tired of being tracked all the time and getting notifications about everything (which yes, I know can be adjusted). I\u2019ve owned Casio watches before and still have a G-Shock digital that\u2019s been running great for almost 20 years, so after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, it was an easy decision to make.\n\nI went with the black face and bezel model, although you really can\u2019t go wrong with any of the other colors offered. It\u2019s a classic diving watch that, in my opinion, looks sturdy, cleaner and more elegant than some of the more expensive competitors. Given Casio\u2019s proven durability over the decades and the price point of this particular watch, you can't miss with this one.\n\nThere are a ton of You Tube videos and review articles online about this diver (which is a bit of a cult classic it seems) \u2013 the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly positive, so I won\u2019t add much more here that hasn\u2019t already been stated there. One common \u201ccomplaint\u201d that I noticed though is regarding the stock watchband. Many are critical of it, but I tend to disagree.\n\nI did take the advice of some and tried a few different aftermarket bands \u2013 the Barton elite silicone, a Ritchie classic leather band, and a Ritchie nylon NATO strap (all available on Amazon). With the exception of the NATO, I personally found the stock Casio diver band the watch comes with to be the most comfortable of the others tried \u2013 not taking away from or knocking the others by any means, it\u2019s just a \u201cwhy spend the extra money\u201d type thing for a $50-ish watch. Simply a personal thing\u2026\n\nRe the NATO strap in my pics: I did keep the Ritchie Premium Nylon strap to compliment the watch. It really does dress it up and make the timepiece pop for more \u201cformal\u201d occasions if you will \u2013 and very comfortable too. For everyday use though, the stock classic diver-style band turned out to be the most practical for me \u2013 one I recommend over aftermarket options and especially for those in the trades or who are knocking around on the beach, out hunting, at the lake, etc.\n\nIf I had to be critical of any aspect of this watch, it would be the luminescent capacity of the hands and markers \u2013 something also frequently mentioned in many of the reviews I read online. It\u2019s marginal at best. When blasted with high intensity light, the markers glow brilliantly initially, but it does seem to fade quick. I mention it because if this is an important feature for you night owls, it is something to consider. For me, it\u2019s acceptable and not enough of a factor for me to change my rating of the piece.\n\nBottom line is that I highly recommend this waterproof diver. It\u2019s superior quality with Casio durability and reliability at a price that can\u2019t be beat. It keeps d***-near perfect time and doesn\u2019t have to be charged on a daily basis or wound ever \u2013 just a simple, inexpensive battery keeps it going for a couple of years. You will not be disappointed with this one! Thx, DT\n\nEdit 2/2/2024: A word on timekeeping: Having owned this watch for a while now, it does GAIN a few seconds every month. I go to www.time.gov to set adjust time every now and then... It's still more accurate than my other watches though - amazing considering this is a $50-ish dollar piece. Highly recommend this watch!\nRead more",

                "review_text": "Have had this for about a week now and love it. Set it to the atomic clock via phone when I first got it and it hasn't lost or gained a single second yet. That kind of accuracy for a $45 watch is incredible. It's hefty and rugged, but not overwhelming, and sits perfectly on my wrist. Both the second and minute hands align perfectly with the indices on the dial as they make their way around the watch face. Also, the case back is perfectly aligned with the 12/6 axis on the front of the watch. The lume on the face and hands is more than bright enough to see what time it is in the dark, thought it takes a bit of concentration to locate the second hand since the lume on it is quite small. The rotating bezel has a very solid click to it, and only rotates counter-clockwise so as to be truly useful when I go diving (those who complain that it doesn't rotate in both directions are clearly not divers and don't understand how a dive watch is supposed to function). My only challenge with this watch is that my poor presbyopic eyes can't make out the tiny date without my glasses on, however there are many jewelers that can affix a small magnifying bubble over the date window for very little cost, which should easily remedy the problem. At least I knew going into this purchase that I'd need to address the unmagnified date at some point, so I'm not going to deduct anything for that. Still, Casio could fix this very minor shortcoming for next to nothing. The 200m water resistance is also a very nice feature, and is much of the reason I bought it. I don't want to have to worry about forgetting to take off my watch when I shower, dive, do dishes, wash the car, mess with the lawn sprinklers or any of the other myriad things involving water that I'd have to be a lot more conscious of with a more delicate watch. I can work in the yard or on the car and get filthy, then just wash up and not fret about getting Goop or other hand-cleaners on the watch. Being able to rinse it off or even lightly scrub it with a toothbrush and some mild soap is a huge bonus. Just make sure the crown is securely screwed all the way in. Mine was a little tough to manipulate in that I couldn't really tell at first if it was all the way out for initial adjustment, plus the first and second pull-out stops were not overtly obvious. However, given the incredible accuracy of this watch, that is a one-time adjustment until the battery eventually dies (or I travel to another time zone and have to reset the hour hand, but I can easily live with that 5-6 times a year and, if anything, will get more intimate with exactly where the proper crown click is).\n\nI switched back to a good ol' fashioned analog watch when I came to the conclusion that I just don't use all of the bells and whistles on my digital watches any more. I can read this one in the dark with nothing more than a slight turn of the wrist. No more having to fumble for a backlight button. It looks like a far more expensive watch than it is, and it's classy and \"timeless\" design will always be in style. A nice leather band will dress this up very nicely. In the event I ever lose this one or beat it up so badly that it just won't work any more, I will absolutely buy the exact same thing as a replacement.\nRead more",

Its not over done on the dial and is a nice purely simple diver watch with a moving bezel and date window. $57 and its a great looking watch that goes with casual or a bit more dressed up clothing. The main thing I'd recommend changing is the watch comes with a 22mm watch strap. The rubber one that comes with it is a bit cheap feeling, but its easy to change with a small flathead or correct watch toolkit as amazon sells, I had an extra nylon front/leather back (wrist side) sitting around on a watch i wasn't wearing and was same 22mm, swapped them around not only is the nylon one more comfortable, it looks better too. Images in review show the casio swapped with the other watch i swapped the bands on, the silver case is the casio with the band that came factory from the black case one with the casio factory strap, as i don't wear that particular watch as often as the casio. This casio is comfortable and very accurate as well as seeming to be very sturdily built.",

The analog display is not that useful but a nice-to-have. Setting the time and date is rather straight forward as it's similar to the GShocks. Timekeeping seems accurate based on comparison with my phone's clock. The bracelet feels very comfortable on my average size wrist. Bracelet link adjustment is a chore as it requires fine manual dexterity and finger strength to manage the fold-over links. The watch has a retro-vintage appeal and appearance. For $35 it is a bargain and I recommend it if you're thinking of getting a digital wristwatch. It's a Casio; so it is well made, simple to use and affordable.",

I'm still playing with the various settings but it's a really neat design and I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling since you can set multiple different timezones. The back light is plenty bright too with a orange glow. It has a lot going on. I was apprehensive about a watch under 30 bucks but it's worth it. I also think the metal band is well worth the extra 10 bucks. It says 10 year battery life on the housing but I guess we'll see. Lastly as far as fashion goes, I think it's nice and versatile. It looks just as good in your casual close as it does with your work attire and your Sunday best. I also like that it reads time down to the second. It's nice to know how accurately I can set this watch. How it will preform long term, I can't say but I'm optimistic judging from what I'm seeing. Anyway, I would recommend this to a friend.

The band was different from other similar ones I have and didn't have straight pins to drive out to separate the links. It took me a few minutes to figure out it had a U-shaped clip you have to remove first. I didn't knock off a star for this, but I'd still have preferred at least a drawing of how it was assembled.\n\nThings I really like about this watch:\n\nMultiple time zones. I can quickly switch between my local time, UTC (for ham radio) and where ever my family members or I are while traveling.\n\n12 or 24 hour time display. Especially handy for ham radio and multiple time zones.\n\nStop watch. Nice for keeping track of workouts or trips.\n\nThe back light. Nice and bright. Lights up the whole display. You can set it to stay on 1 or 3 seconds per button push.\n\nVarious alarms I haven't messed with yet, so I cannot say if it's loud enough to wake me up or not.\n\nThis watch has all the functions I want in my every day wear watch and not much I'd just never use anyway.\n\nAnd it's water resistant deeper than I'll swim.\n\nAll while looking good enough to wear wherever I go and whatever I'm doing. I don't hang out in Monte Carlo.\nRead more",

He needs to be readily able to access the time and date, and to be able to glance at your wrist and have a watch light up so well helps so much. This one is basic to real prettiness to it but it gets the job done, and it displays the time and date accurately. He wears it everyday, shower and all, if he forgets to remove it, it gets sweated on too, if he forgets when he's really hitting his workout hard.\nOne weird but definitely good thing, I don't notice it harboring smells like plastic bands tend to do!",

                "review_text": "I wanted to wait a few weeks before writing my review but I so impressed with this watch out of the box I couldn't wait. I've read some negative reviews on the watch battery dying after a few weeks. I am sure there is some bad batches out there. This was one major concern I have to be honest. I almost didn't buy it for this reason. I am crossing my fingers this isn't true with mine and plan this watch to me my everyday go to watch. This is my first G shock watch also and I'm blown away with the quality and simple style of this watch. I am a watch collector and wanted to add this watch to my collection. This is not only ideal for military personnel but anyone who is looking for a rugged durable everyday work horse watch. I will revise my review should I have any issues but for now I am very content with the purchase. I am glad I did purchased this solid watch mainly to the gym and outdoors. It appears bullet proof ready for the harshest conditions. Only time will tell if this watch lives up to the name. The back light is a cool light green and the dial us easy to see in the dark. For under $45 bucks this watch was worth every penny. I can't think of any watches that is such as high quality for that price. It super comfort able to wear on the wrist and does not pinch on th. This particular model is a few years old but the skin like some watches do. It's a older model but better than some current models that are higher in price. Its just my opinion. If this watch lasts long time then I will purchase another G shock again in the future.",

I really like the mineral crystal because it is so much stronger than the acrylic, and it just looks better, especially considering it doesn't scratch as easily. My last watch (Timex Ironman Triathlon) had an acrylic crystal and had all sorts of scratches after just two months. Working in a warehouse, I need something that will stand up to daily abuse; I think this is the one.\n\nUpdate 2.5 months: not a single scratch on the crystal.\n\n5 months: Still not a scratch and other than some scuffs on the band, it still looks new. My hands don't even look that good.\n\n1 year: This is impressive! I have yet to see a single scratch on the crystal, and the band is still in great condition. A lot more than I can say for my Ironman Triathlon watch.\n\nShortly after my 1-year update, this watch reset itself. It has done this 3 times; twice in 2 days' time. I'm not sure what caused it, but it was a minor annoyance having to reset the date and time.\n\n2 years: The watch hasn't reset itself, since before I wrote the last update. And there are still no scratches on the crystal. The band has also held up well.\n\n3.5 years: Minor scratches on the crystal, but they are so faint you have to look for them. One of the two watchband screw covers came off, but that only affected the cosmetics. The band is still holding up strong. The watch never did reset itself again.\nI almost wish the band would break, so I would have an excuse to get a new G-Shock watch.\n\n4.5 years: The battery died last week, but I was able to replace it myself and the batteries are really cheap. There are now a few extremely minor scratches on the crystal, but unless you are looking for them, you won't see them. The band is still holding up strong and the rest of the watch has nothing more than some casual wear, minus the watchband covers which were both removed and unnecessary. I'm still not sure of the purpose of those covers, other than cosmetics. I can't say for sure whether the watch runs slow or fast because I have generally set my watches about 4\u20135 minutes ahead.\n\nThis will be my last update. I have been wanting an analog watch for a while, so I have decided to retire this one. After having this great experience with G-Shock, I have decided it is time for an upgrade and will be replacing it with a G-Shock GSTB400.\nRead more",

I was reluctant to pay the full original price of $275, so I decided to chance it with Amazon, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. Having owned this exact model before, I feel very confident I can spot a real vs. fake MK watch. It met almost all the criteria to determine that it's real. Here are the positives and negatives:\n\nCriteria to determine authenticity:\n\n- Model number (MK-8344) matches original and is included on the back of the dial\n- The Michael Kors logo is featured on the dial.\n- The font of the letters is consistent with the official brand logo\n- The spacing is even, and that the quality of finish is high.\n- Came in original Michael Kors box where one edge is broader than the other, with a clear writing of \u2018Michael Kors\u2019 on it.\n- The lid was wider and bigger than the box, covering a major portion of it, meaning it's authentic.\n- The Michael Kors logo is included on the top of the box in fine and clear text.\n- The box has a batch stamp located on the bottom.\n- \u201cAll Stainless Steel\u201d at the top in a semicircular pattern along with the model number.\n- Original MK logo embossed on the crown\n- Has three sub-dials with three different number values (a fake MK watch will have subdials that showcase the same values.)\n- Displays date with a proper alignment inside the window (in a fake watch, the display is disputable and unaligned)\n\nNegatives:\n\n- No warranty booklet included.\n- No extra link included\n\nAlthough it didn't meet every expectation, you still can't beat the quality and price. A part of me thinks that most of the 1-2 star reviews are from people who have a vested interest in seeing you pay full price, so they leave negative comments to scare you into going to Macy's or MK directly. Don't let them fool you. This watch appears to be genuine, and even if it's not, it's the best damn fake I've ever seen.\nRead more",

                "review_text": "Bought on sale approaching Christmas 2022 at 50% off for $48.\n\nSIZE: The watch case is 42mm which might not fit SM/MED wrists. See my photos for fitment on a XL hand with normal wrists.\n\nSTYLE: I bought the 'Brown' model which has a very nice dark coffee brown band with a goldish-tan face, black digits and luminescent hands. I liked what I saw in the sales post, but think this watch would make a wonderful gift for any occasion. The contour of the face is eye-catching without being too much. I tested the luminescence and found I could identify time well enough. Case height is average. I do plan on adding a glass face protector to go on top to protect the original glass. This watch is 5 ATM so can withstand water pressure up to a depth of 50 meters before it suffers water damage. Personally, I wouldn't purposefully swim with a 5 ATM with a leather band, but it's comforting to know this watch is okay swimming for short periods of time or even worn in the shower and rain.\n\nPACKAGING: Amazon shipped this in a bubble envelope which adequately protected the standard, and squarish, FOSSIL tin container with teal and orange accents; the same tin shown in the sales ad photos. If your watch came in anything different then Once opened, the watch itself was in a protective plastic sheath, and the watch face has a plastic layer on both the front and back.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with the watch both in the stout packaging, and its quality and appearance. I generally wear higher end watches but the appearance and minimalist design of this one caught my eye. It's the perfect watch for casual to casual-dress attire, and was an easy add to my collection at a very affordable sale price.\nRead more",

It's much lighter than I anticipated but it's still very well made and everything functions properly.\n\nThe giftbox I received was pretty banged up. Lots of scratches/dents and overall just cheap junk. But easily replaceable by buying a different watch case, which I will be doing.\n\nIncluded inside the giftbox is a registration card. Typically, I wouldn't take the time to do so, but I was slightly skeptical of the watch being genuine and wanted verification of authenticity. The registration process was super simple and took about 2 minutes and the actually checked out to be a REAL Fossil watch.\n\nEven with the rinky-dink box, I would totally recommend buying this watch and I'm looking forward to my fianc\u00e9 s reaction on Christmas!",
