Even beyond the class and my job, I can\u2019t leave the house without my little watch, and I never liked wearing watches before. I\u2019ve had an Apple Watch in the past and I honestly prefer this. It\u2019s perfect for anything I\u2019d need, waterproof, has the date, day of the week, time zone and a stop watch. The reviews didn\u2019t mention this but when you turn the flash on to see the screen in the dark there\u2019s even cute little animations of animals. It\u2019s precious-I\u2019m already thinking about buying a second one just in case anything happens to mine. I love it couldn\u2019t recommend enough!!

This watch is all metal, and at first the metal strap pinched my wrist and my wrist hair. After about 4 days of wearing the watch, the strap stopped irritating me. I can wear the watch now with no problem.\n\nThe watch face was a little smaller than I expected but it is easily readable. The watch has both standard 12 hour time and military time. It keeps track of the day of the week and the date. It has an alarm that you can program, a stop watch, and a light.\n\nThe watch can be adjusted to fit any wrist size. The best way to adjust the watch is to use a fork to pry open the latch so it can be moved to the position that best fits your wrist (look up a video).\n\nOverall for around $20.00 this a great watch that is functional and comfortable. I have gotten many compliments on its retro style. I have found the watch is scratch resistant as well.",

                "review_text": "I\u2019m over big, bulky watches. I\u2019ve got my Suunto and a couple G-Shock watches. I still wear them, still love them, but mostly I just want a watch that keeps nice, precise time, doesn\u2019t stand out from my wrist 3/4 inch and hopefully looks juuuust a little dorky. I\u2019m also cheap. Waterproofness is important to me. I work a desk job. I commute by bus or train- watches help with that. I like to go on a run a couple times a week and wear a watch. I don\u2019t sleep or shower with my watch on unless I\u2019m camping or in a hotel. I like digital over analog because I kind of like to know exactly what time I think it is and I only ever estimate when I\u2019m reading an analog watch because I\u2019m lazy. Also, when I\u2019m in a meeting or I\u2019ve been pinned-down by someone I don\u2019t want to talk to and I want to know if this really is taking forever or if my perception of the passage of time is just being warped- it\u2019s easier to sneak a peek at a digital watch and get a precise read. I realized a few months ago that I really am just as happy wearing a $15 Casio as I am with my $250 Suunto and that most days I don\u2019t need to know the barometric pressure. Some days, yes. Most days, no. But I like having a variety of watches (including the Suunto, which is fabulous). And I like to choose which watch to wear each morning. That\u2019s fun for me. Recently I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch of new cheap Casio watches. I got four new watches for $52. I think Timex\u2019s are over-priced. That\u2019s how cheap I am.\n\nCasio W-800HAV ($20-ish) Digital Black. My eight-year old son and I each got one of these watches for Christmas 2016. We both love it. We both have other watches but wear this one the most. It has a fairly low profile- doesn\u2019t catch on pockets or shirt sleeves. I love the light- it looks stupid, like piddly. But it actually lights the face well. I go jogging at night sometimes. The light works well enough for me to see how slow I am even while I\u2019m bouncing down the road. And it\u2019s got \u201cDual Display\u201d. I don\u2019t know what else to call that. It shows the time on one part of the screen and at the same time it show the stopwatch numbers. Nice to keep track of both. Or, If I\u2019m out and about, I\u2019ll set a stopwatch when the train goes by because I know that the train comes by every 15 minutes. So I can see when I\u2019m coming up on another 15-minute mark and also see the time on the sub-display.\n\nCasio F-201WA ($10.47) Digital Black. Comfortable. Lightweight. Easiest buttons to push. Good light. I like that it has countdown timer and lots of alarms. I miss being able to see the time when it\u2019s in stopwatch mode like I can with the W-800HAV and the WV-200A.\n\nCasio WV-200A ($40-ish) Waceceptor Digital Black with chrome and red. Looks good. Like the steel case. Good protection for the glass. Relatively heavy. A liiiiitle too thick. Really nice buttons. Great electro-luminescent light. This one is the only watch of the group that you can set it so it doesn\u2019t beep every time you push a button. I really like being able to turn the beep off. Sometimes I like to set a stopwatch in a meeting so I can see how long somebody is going on with some bullsh*t. Strangely, timing somebody\u2019s bullsh*t is a nice distraction from the bullsh*t. But I don\u2019t like my watch to beep when I\u2019m doing pushing buttons. \u201cDual display\u201d- you can still see what time it is when you\u2019re in other modes. Countdown timer is nice and many of my other watches don\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t give it extra points for the whole Wave Ceptor thing. Doesn\u2019t add any value for me and it kinda sucks battery. This watch has been on my wrist for a full day of snorkelling and handled it beautifully. I live in a land-locked state, so when I get to the ocean, I\u2019m in the water ALL DAY LONG. I can\u2019t dive deeper than maybe 20 feet, so it\u2019s not a serious test for a watch that says it\u2019s good to 200m. But if you\u2019re diving to 200m and time is critical, you\u2019re going to spring for something more than a $40 Casio. (I love you, Casio).\n\nCasio HDA-600 ($14.79) Black Analog. Not the most comfortable. Kinda squeezes my wrist from bone to bone or flops around a bit. I dunno, it just fits weird. YMMV. Love the face protector. Can\u2019t wait until it starts to look a little banged up. Glowy dots on the hands aren\u2019t really impressive. Date window works perfectly. Looks tough but it\u2019s probably not. I like it a lot.\n\nCasio MQ24-7B2 ($14-something) White-faced Analog. Incredibly light. Truly forget that you\u2019re wearing it. Easy to read. No date window. No lumi. Nice, simple and never catches your sleeve in a dress shirt. Yes, I\u2019m fancy. Some people are smart enough to read an analog watch that doesn\u2019t have numbers on it- just dots. I\u2019m not one of those people. I screw it up enough when there\u2019s numbers. This has numbers. I like numbers. Haven\u2019t tested this one for waterproofyness. Casio only says it\u2019s water resistant. I hardly ever do underwater demolitions anymore.\n\nCasio A168W-1 ($16.15) Stainless Digital. I love / hate this watch. I don\u2019t know if Casio was really trying to make a watch that looks fancy but it\u2019s really a dork-bomb, or if they we\u2019re going for dork-bomb as their aim. Either way. This watch is a stunning success. I think this watch is the pinnacle of nerd-swank. 1980\u2019s wannabe stockbroker, cool old guy who doesn\u2019t give a sh*t, little bit of silver under the sleeve to catch someone\u2019s eye- oh wait it\u2019s a friggin Casio digital. I mean, it\u2019s chrome-plated PLASTIC for crying out loud. How awesome is that? I love all of that. Love it. It\u2019s got the Illuminator light, which works great. Clock, date, stopwatch and alarm. No countdown timer. The metal band is not comfortable. It\u2019s got edges and it pulls on my arm fur. Clasp works great and it\u2019s wicked-easy to adjust. Slips under a dress shirt easily. Again: super-dorky. Makes me smile every time I put it on. Then wince when it pulls the fur.\n\nCasio F91W-1 ($11.35) Black Digital. I like this watch a lot. It\u2019s super thin. Very lightweight. The light looks stupid but it works well. The buttons are easy to hit. It ranks pretty high on the \u2018Dork\u2019 scale. People recognize it. Hold that one button down and it says CASIo. It\u2019s great. Proud to say I\u2019ve never worn this watch along with flannel and a beanie. Never.\nRead more",

                "review_text": "As my eyesight gets worse with age, I was looking for a durable, waterproof, easy-to-read watch with a simple timer that looked great on my wrist. I own both a Fitbit and Apple watch \u2013 I was getting tired of being tracked all the time and getting notifications about everything (which yes, I know can be adjusted). I\u2019ve owned Casio watches before and still have a G-Shock digital that\u2019s been running great for almost 20 years, so after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, it was an easy decision to make.\n\nI went with the black face and bezel model, although you really can\u2019t go wrong with any of the other colors offered. It\u2019s a classic diving watch that, in my opinion, looks sturdy, cleaner and more elegant than some of the more expensive competitors. Given Casio\u2019s proven durability over the decades and the price point of this particular watch, you can't miss with this one.\n\nThere are a ton of You Tube videos and review articles online about this diver (which is a bit of a cult classic it seems) \u2013 the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly positive, so I won\u2019t add much more here that hasn\u2019t already been stated there. One common \u201ccomplaint\u201d that I noticed though is regarding the stock watchband. Many are critical of it, but I tend to disagree.\n\nI did take the advice of some and tried a few different aftermarket bands \u2013 the Barton elite silicone, a Ritchie classic leather band, and a Ritchie nylon NATO strap (all available on Amazon). With the exception of the NATO, I personally found the stock Casio diver band the watch comes with to be the most comfortable of the others tried \u2013 not taking away from or knocking the others by any means, it\u2019s just a \u201cwhy spend the extra money\u201d type thing for a $50-ish watch. Simply a personal thing\u2026\n\nRe the NATO strap in my pics: I did keep the Ritchie Premium Nylon strap to compliment the watch. It really does dress it up and make the timepiece pop for more \u201cformal\u201d occasions if you will \u2013 and very comfortable too. For everyday use though, the stock classic diver-style band turned out to be the most practical for me \u2013 one I recommend over aftermarket options and especially for those in the trades or who are knocking around on the beach, out hunting, at the lake, etc.\n\nIf I had to be critical of any aspect of this watch, it would be the luminescent capacity of the hands and markers \u2013 something also frequently mentioned in many of the reviews I read online. It\u2019s marginal at best. When blasted with high intensity light, the markers glow brilliantly initially, but it does seem to fade quick. I mention it because if this is an important feature for you night owls, it is something to consider. For me, it\u2019s acceptable and not enough of a factor for me to change my rating of the piece.\n\nBottom line is that I highly recommend this waterproof diver. It\u2019s superior quality with Casio durability and reliability at a price that can\u2019t be beat. It keeps d***-near perfect time and doesn\u2019t have to be charged on a daily basis or wound ever \u2013 just a simple, inexpensive battery keeps it going for a couple of years. You will not be disappointed with this one! Thx, DT\n\nEdit 2/2/2024: A word on timekeeping: Having owned this watch for a while now, it does GAIN a few seconds every month. I go to www.time.gov to set adjust time every now and then... It's still more accurate than my other watches though - amazing considering this is a $50-ish dollar piece. Highly recommend this watch!\nRead more",

                "review_text": "Have had this for about a week now and love it. Set it to the atomic clock via phone when I first got it and it hasn't lost or gained a single second yet. That kind of accuracy for a $45 watch is incredible. It's hefty and rugged, but not overwhelming, and sits perfectly on my wrist. Both the second and minute hands align perfectly with the indices on the dial as they make their way around the watch face. Also, the case back is perfectly aligned with the 12/6 axis on the front of the watch. The lume on the face and hands is more than bright enough to see what time it is in the dark, thought it takes a bit of concentration to locate the second hand since the lume on it is quite small. The rotating bezel has a very solid click to it, and only rotates counter-clockwise so as to be truly useful when I go diving (those who complain that it doesn't rotate in both directions are clearly not divers and don't understand how a dive watch is supposed to function). My only challenge with this watch is that my poor presbyopic eyes can't make out the tiny date without my glasses on, however there are many jewelers that can affix a small magnifying bubble over the date window for very little cost, which should easily remedy the problem. At least I knew going into this purchase that I'd need to address the unmagnified date at some point, so I'm not going to deduct anything for that. Still, Casio could fix this very minor shortcoming for next to nothing. The 200m water resistance is also a very nice feature, and is much of the reason I bought it. I don't want to have to worry about forgetting to take off my watch when I shower, dive, do dishes, wash the car, mess with the lawn sprinklers or any of the other myriad things involving water that I'd have to be a lot more conscious of with a more delicate watch. I can work in the yard or on the car and get filthy, then just wash up and not fret about getting Goop or other hand-cleaners on the watch. Being able to rinse it off or even lightly scrub it with a toothbrush and some mild soap is a huge bonus. Just make sure the crown is securely screwed all the way in. Mine was a little tough to manipulate in that I couldn't really tell at first if it was all the way out for initial adjustment, plus the first and second pull-out stops were not overtly obvious. However, given the incredible accuracy of this watch, that is a one-time adjustment until the battery eventually dies (or I travel to another time zone and have to reset the hour hand, but I can easily live with that 5-6 times a year and, if anything, will get more intimate with exactly where the proper crown click is).\n\nI switched back to a good ol' fashioned analog watch when I came to the conclusion that I just don't use all of the bells and whistles on my digital watches any more. I can read this one in the dark with nothing more than a slight turn of the wrist. No more having to fumble for a backlight button. It looks like a far more expensive watch than it is, and it's classy and \"timeless\" design will always be in style. A nice leather band will dress this up very nicely. In the event I ever lose this one or beat it up so badly that it just won't work any more, I will absolutely buy the exact same thing as a replacement.\nRead more",

Its not over done on the dial and is a nice purely simple diver watch with a moving bezel and date window. $57 and its a great looking watch that goes with casual or a bit more dressed up clothing. The main thing I'd recommend changing is the watch comes with a 22mm watch strap. The rubber one that comes with it is a bit cheap feeling, but its easy to change with a small flathead or correct watch toolkit as amazon sells, I had an extra nylon front/leather back (wrist side) sitting around on a watch i wasn't wearing and was same 22mm, swapped them around not only is the nylon one more comfortable, it looks better too. Images in review show the casio swapped with the other watch i swapped the bands on, the silver case is the casio with the band that came factory from the black case one with the casio factory strap, as i don't wear that particular watch as often as the casio. This casio is comfortable and very accurate as well as seeming to be very sturdily built.",

(Case is plastic but bracelet is stainless.\nBut case matches stainless well.) The digital display is large enough to read the time but the date image is rather small. The analog display is not that useful but a nice-to-have. Setting the time and date is rather straight forward as it's similar to the GShocks. Timekeeping seems accurate based on comparison with my phone's clock. The bracelet feels very comfortable on my average size wrist. Bracelet link adjustment is a chore as it requires fine manual dexterity and finger strength to manage the fold-over links. The watch has a retro-vintage appeal and appearance. For $35 it is a bargain and I recommend it if you're thinking of getting a digital wristwatch. It's a Casio; so it is well made, simple to use and affordable.",

That said it's has plenty of adgusttments to get a nice fit. Feels nice and the screen is very clear and the stainless is very attractive. It feels like far higher quality then what you pay for. I'm still playing with the various settings but it's a really neat design and I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling since you can set multiple different timezones. The back light is plenty bright too with a orange glow. It has a lot going on. I was apprehensive about a watch under 30 bucks but it's worth it. I also think the metal band is well worth the extra 10 bucks. It says 10 year battery life on the housing but I guess we'll see. Lastly as far as fashion goes, I think it's nice and versatile. It looks just as good in your casual close as it does with your work attire and your Sunday best. I also like that it reads time down to the second. It's nice to know how accurately I can set this watch. How it will preform long term, I can't say but I'm optimistic judging from what I'm seeing. Anyway, I would recommend this to a friend.

It took me a few minutes to figure out it had a U-shaped clip you have to remove first. I didn't knock off a star for this, but I'd still have preferred at least a drawing of how it was assembled.\n\nThings I really like about this watch:\n\nMultiple time zones. I can quickly switch between my local time, UTC (for ham radio) and where ever my family members or I are while traveling.\n\n12 or 24 hour time display. Especially handy for ham radio and multiple time zones.\n\nStop watch. Nice for keeping track of workouts or trips.\n\nThe back light. Nice and bright. Lights up the whole display. You can set it to stay on 1 or 3 seconds per button push.\n\nVarious alarms I haven't messed with yet, so I cannot say if it's loud enough to wake me up or not.\n\nThis watch has all the functions I want in my every day wear watch and not much I'd just never use anyway.\n\nAnd it's water resistant deeper than I'll swim.\n\nAll while looking good enough to wear wherever I go and whatever I'm doing. I don't hang out in Monte Carlo.\nRead more",

'\n\nI think it runs a little behind, or ahead Im not sure, what i do know is that i sincronized it with an exact model of the same watch but in silver, bought from same seller, and after a week the beeps where not unisone. One of them beeped 2 seconds ahead. or late. whatever.\n\nThat doesn't bother me, i dont really need it to be THAT accurate.\n\nI have 5 of them. one reason is that i sell them forward in mexico's ebay ( mercado libre) , just as a hobby, i've sold like 4 of them.\nI did it because paying for shippment of one only watch seemed stupid so i bought 8.\n\nBut If you like it a lot, i would recomend getting at least 2.\n\nMy hand is not hairy, but some peopple wrote that hairs often get cought on the wristband and are pulled off, cousing pain.\nRead more",

I was hesitant at first to get this watch from this seller on Amazon because of the color in the picture. The color is definitely gold in tone, not super shiny. I would say kind of matte gold.\n\nI was able to get a real idea of the size by the measurements posted on the sellers ad. I compared it to the watches I already have and the size is exactly what I wanted. I am a female with small wrists and it fit perfectly.\n\nThe band is easily adjustable. I looked it up on YouTube and it took like a minute to adjust it to my small wrist. The extra band will be tucked inside but you can't see it and it doesn't bother me. Some people have said it pulls their hairs but I don't have hairy arms so it's perfect for me.\n\nThe quality is ok, I guess. I don't own any super expensive watches so I wouldn't even be able to compare but overall I would say the quality is what you pay for. I'm ok with that. It's not heavy and of course it's not real gold. Everything works on my watch. (i.e. light, buttons, alarm etc.) I read the manual and I was able to easily set the time, date and alarms. No problem there. I don't know if its real or fake but it doesn't really matter to me. It looks really good.\n\nI've read some reviews on the gold color fading with time. I plan on trying my best to not get it wet and wiping it after every use. As of right now, I plan on wearing it a lot. It's something I can wear up or down.\n\nThe packaging was ok. It came in a plastic case with the watch holder, manual and a Casio box. No complaints there.\n\nThis is my review upon receiving my watch. I will edit and update if there are any changes.\nRead more",
