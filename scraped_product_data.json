One asked, \"Is that a Hamilton?\" Their jaws drop when I tell them it's an Amazon Essentials. They really are stunned when I tell them the price.

All I have said about the black one is true of the green version, but the green and gold is simply beautiful. For the quality the price is amazing. One problem is the low water resistance. I will make sure to not get them wet and absolutely no bathing or swimming. Another problem is no hacking, so it cannot be set to the second. edit: The new version does have hacking. Finally although the black strap was comfortable from the beginning, the green strap was very stiff and took a bit of work to break it in. It is comfortable now.",

This one is stylish enough to wear in a formal context, but has a tasteful, modern flair to it-- like, you're going to see a matinee performance of the local symphony, but in the recently-opened, ultramodern auditorium, kind of a thing. The color palette is generally striking in how rare watches make good use of brown (or metallic brown) as a color for something other than leather, but then you also get the skeleton element of being able to see the spinny bits inside.\n\nRoman numerals I'm not usually a fan of because their inferior legibility to Arabic numerals, but this one I made an exception for because it was pretty. Also have glowy hands and number markings, so you can read the watch in the dark (even if it's not as clear as if the numbers were painted as well-- we can't all be perfect, including this watch).\n\nThe movement seems decent and functional, but it's not a particularly high-end one, as indicated by the fact that the rotor is annoyingly loud (plus the relative lack of ornamentation). The movement itself is super quiet when the rotor isn't moving. I don't have much experience with Miyotas but this one seems fine, and it's also easy and super smooth to set the time. They aren't super accurate so you have to check them frequently, but if you're within a few minutes and aren't using this watch to run scientific experiments that go on for weeks at a time, you should be good.\n\nThere is one proper complaint I have and that's the deployant clasp. I don't have a great reason for hating deployant clasps, but I'm am much more a fan of the old school pin-and-buckle style. The big thing about this one that's annoying is that the pin to set it in place requires Herculean precision and strength to undo and adjust. It is not an easy thing.\n\nAnyway, this is a great lil watch. Recommended.\nRead more",

I also like the black and steal loom of the dial.I have a collection of watches ranging from cheap $40 use and toss, through battery operated mechanisms, to expensive $3000+ watches. Mechanical = automatic or hand-winding watches are definitely the best way to go. If you have several automatics, buy a cheap watch-winder on Amazon, or wherever. Just make sure the small motor that rotates your watches is quiet! I got a brilliant 8 watch winder with storage for 8 more for $240. Great convenience, as well as good display. I also prefer leather bands and deployment clasps, which this model has. They can be expanded or tightened easily, according to the weather and ones usage, and they don't scratch as link bracelets do. They are also readily replaced when worn out, or when you just want a change. I have one question about this watch though; The sub-dial for the seconds can't be stopped when setting the watch time, hence even if your hours/minutes are accurate, the seconds are out, albeit slightly. usually pulling out the crown stops the seconds too. Unless I've missed something, or mine has a fault, you can't do this on this watch,as they keep right on ticking away. A small but noticeable design/movement fault I think.",

My dad is frugal and likes that in his gifts, but low price doesn't have to mean junk. Also, he finds digitals tacky (so all the good low-end Casios were a no go).\n\nI found this Timex, \"scratch & dent\" on Amazon for just shy of $20, it arrived with the box all beat up, the leather strap was not attached, and there were no spring bars. Still, the watch and strap were in brand new shape. I keep spare spring bars and it was easy to pop the strap on. Strap is on the short side, if you have larger than a 7.5\" wrist, you'll probably need a different one (a NATO would work well on it, imo). Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.\n\nHighly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.\n\nWatch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.\n\nI rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks. Though buyer beware with scratch & dent, if I didn't already have spare spring bars, I would have been irritated.\nRead more",

                "review_text": "I've been looking for a casual watch for these past few months and this beauty is the one. I was lucky to come across this watch as I was just about to buy a $500 Citizen I had my eyes on from the last visit to the store. The saved money is real handy for a kid still in school. And I'm sure you've assumed already, I ended up buying the Timex Reader and I don't regret it.\n\nI already had an idea(a petty one) about what kind of watch I wanted. One with a leather strap, red second hand, simple ~40mm white face w/date, silver case. So it was awesome to find the Timex Reader. But after scrolling down the page and reading a few negative reviews about the absurd noise, pesky date setting and also the cheap price I was skeptical about the purchase. Whatever, I decided to just order it and see for myself.\n\nHere's my some information about the watch if you're considering buying it,\n\nThe face:\nIt's white, just like the picture. I only say this because other watches by Timex advertise online a white face but are actually a yellow-creamy hue.\nThe Indiglo:\nIt's the colour teal and it also doesn't entirely light up the face of the watch. There's about half a centimeter of unlit area at the top of the watch. Think of it like a nearly-filled fish tank. It's a feature I won't see myself using much, so I care little about the defect.\nThe Band:\nIt's not as brown as the picture would make you think. Some reviewers agree that it's a Maroon Red. When you actually zoom in on the image, you can see the red that I'm talking about. Just assume that it's reddish and not brown for expectations.\nThe noise:\nI'm a student with a PC and a fan always running. So obviously this small watch won't over power the noise. With the watch up to my ear, of course I hear ticking but I personally find the repetitive sound soothing. Just a tip, apparently if you put the watch FACE down it some-what mutes the sound from what I read from some reviews.\nThe time/date:\nWhat do you do when you get a watch? You set it's time. Right away, I was super frustrated with setting time and date with this watch like other reviewers. A little side story, I kept pulling and pulling the crown to get a certain time setting and the ENTIRE CROWN came out! It looked like a metal toothpick. I was confused about what the hell just happened and sorta like when you drop a vase and sweep it under the carpet, I immediately shoved the little guy back in the hole without much thought. I'm not very technical when it comes it watches which would explain why I'm sounding like a stooge. Anyways, the watch still worked and I did end up figuring out how to set the time and it was a lot easier than I first thought. Throw away the instructions from the box and follow mine instructions below.\n\nHow to set time:\n1. Set Day of Week (Thursday, Friday, etc.)\nPull crown out and move it clockwise. If the time is being adjusted, you're doing it right. Keep turning it to get the right day of the week. For me I had to keep turning 3 full days, essentially 6 full 12 hour rotations.\n\n2. Set Date (1st, 4th, 29th, etc.)\nPull crown out A LITTLE BIT. So little that there's barely a gap between it and the watch case. Then move the crown and you can set the date.\n\n3. Set Time (12:39, 1:04, etc.)\nPull crown out normally just like when you set Day of Week and just set time as you would any other watch.\n\nBy the way, when I say pull crown out, I don't mean entirely out of the watch like I did earlier. Once you pull out the crown and it seems it doesn't want to come out a centimeter more, then that's as far as it should go.\n\nOverall, great watch, great price, great buy.\nRead more",

I'm a little surprised that even my wife has mentioned a couple of times that it's a nice looking watch. Don't get me wrong, no one will mistake it for a $300 watch but I like how it looks and that's good enough for me. I wanted an inexpensive daily watch with Arabic numerals, easy to read and not too cluttered, with a little bit of field watch look and this watch met the need. For comparison's sake, the other option I was considering was a Seiko 5 field type watch, which would be fine but also at least 3 times more expensive and I didn't want another Japanese watch, I already have a Citizen Promaster so I'm good on that score and I didn't feel like coughing up a few hundred bucks for a Swiss automatic movement. I'll list my pros and cons and make it short:\nPros:\n- good looking face, large Arabic numerals\n- size is about right for my personal taste, I don't like larger diameter watches but some people do\n- light weight was moderately important to me\n- accuracy, telling the time accurately is a watch's reason for being, and I think this is plenty accurate, about the same my Citizen Promaster or even a little tighter, really, but I'm not such an important person as to worry about a couple of seconds off here and there\n- solar, so no battery changes to fool around with the Expedition Solar version I purchased\n\nCons: I don't have any strong negative opinions for this watch, particularly considering the price bracket we are in, but I will say\n- the lume is a little on the weak side, it doesn't last very long in my opinion so it would be hard to read at night or in a dark environment\n- height, I could wish it were a little thinner, it's not terrible but I just feel it sits a little taller than it has a right to\n\nTo sum it up again, it's very decent watch and I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars\nRead more",

If you need a watch and don\u2019t need it to connect to your phone, there is literally no reason to buy any other watch, unless you are one of those weirdos that are obsessed with how watches look. It is also super intuitive and easy to use, and the alarm function works great as well. It has 7 years of battery life, which, at a $20 price point is less than one cent per day to always know the time, have a stopwatch, and have an alarm. At night, the light works great, and during the day, it is easily readable. I\u2019ve already bought this watch twice, and I just got it again for an upcoming trip where I won\u2019t have my phone. However, I\u2019ve realized that having a watch is just better. Instead of fishing around in your pocket and getting sucked into YouTube, you can just glance at your wrist. Smart watches are dumb and gimmicky. Dumb watches are the way to go, and this is the best dumb watch out there. And if you are even considering buying an analog watch I genuinely don\u2019t know how to help you. Can your analog watch set timers, have a 24 hour clock, have a stopwatch, or be super precise? I didn\u2019t think so. And this watch is waterproof too.",

I enjoy the subdued colors\u2014my favorite color is blue\u2014so the black with blue outline is perfect. Goes with anything. The buttons and setup are very intuitive, I didn't look at any instructions and figured out how to set time and do stuff with it very quickly. The water resistance is good enough to where it won't break when washing dishes, but as the manufacturer says, you shouldn't submerge it or act as if it's water *proof.* Only downside to this watch, as others have mentioned, is the extremely dim light. It sucks. But honestly for $11 (I got it on sale), I can hardly complain. Overall a really nice watch, perfect for someone who just wants a comfortable piece that tells the time and looks decent.",

                "review_text": "I'm a woman and have very small wrists. I wanted a larger watch that I could easily read without squinting or putting on glasses as I don't like wearing glasses that much as I don't need them for my computer. But, I didn't want a huge watch. So, this watch was large without being huge. I knew that the band would not fit snugly, but this band was said by other reviewers to be a big small on them. I like bands to be loose so that they can sit down on my hand when I have long sleeves on or be pushed up a few inches on my arm when I'm doing something messy like cooking dinner. I also wanted an inexpensive but dependable and classic looking watch. Because it became fashionable for women to wear watches that looked like they'd borrowed them from the guy in their life, I felt this would be fine without seeming too odd.\n\nAlso, I like to check the time when I wake up because I wake up so early and don't want to get up so early that I'll be exhausted later. So, the light was important to me. I've had a few Timex watches before, and I found the Indiglo feature very helpful.\n\nI was a little concerned about the stretch band pulling my arm hairs as I'd noticed on a watch a long time ago that that happened. This one very so slightly does that but mainly because it's loose and I move it around. If it were fit so it stayed put on my arm, I don't think it would do that throughout the day. It's not actually a problem as it's so slight. I don't really notice it much.\n\nAs I said, I've had a few Timex watches in my life, and they tend to keep on ticking. My last one, honestly, didn't last more than 18 months, but that was an exception. Fortunately, I got that one very, very cheaply on a sale with points and so on at another retailer. I hope this one lasts for a few years as it has for others.\n\nWhile I like the dull metal stretch band, I am also considering getting silicone bands in different colors. They are pretty inexpensive, and you can get the quick release type that pop in and out easily to be worn with different outfits. I'm thinking of black, buff/pink (kind of like a white person's slightly tanned skin), and red. Maybe white too. For now, I'm just using the silver band. As another reviewer mentioned, the provided band is duller than the watch. However, it actually looks good that way. It's a more casual look than it would be with a shiny band. I also think it would look good with a shiny band, however.\n\nSo, having read that some people had difficulty setting the day of the week, I handed this to my young adult son as he was just sitting around playing on his computer while to did all kinds of housework. He set everything but the day and didn't bother with the day of the week. Not intending to be his slave without any rewards, I looked up directions on the internet, sent them to him, and handed it back with just enough words to every so slightly shame him into doing it. I wasn't mean, but this kid got accepted to MIT. So, he did it. I also asked here for directions and got directions from the manufacturer and several other reviewers. So, look through the questions and the answers are there. Basically, you pull the knob out and turn it through as many 24-hour days as you need to to get to the day of the week you need. I think you go clockwise. The direction matters, so check that first. It's absolutely NOT a big deal once you know how to do it. I think the reason so many people have gotten confused is that these days were are used to clicking on things and having them set right away. It's the same reason many older people have trouble with digital things. They are used to mechanical things. Anyway, it's not a big deal and it's definitely not a reason not to buy the watch.\n\nAs I said, I bought this watch because it had a big face and hands and would be easy to glance at without glasses AND because it had Indiglo lighting when you push the knob AND because it had both the day and the date. I do check my online calendar daily and schedule appointments every single day for my business and personal matters. However, I admit sometimes I forget what day it is and what the date is. One reason I didn't buy the women's version of this watch is that I wanted the DAY and the date, not just the date. The women's version must be too small to have both. What I've noticed is that in dim light, I have a harder time reading small print. Also, the day and date are much smaller than the numerals for the hours. That's normal, of course. But, I do have to work a little harder to read the day and date. Further, the day and date are not illuminated by the Indiglo light. I guess because this is a mechanical watch, they are turning on different disks and don't have that feature. However, when I check my watch in the dark, I only want to know what time it is and don't need to know the day of the week and date. So, it's not actually a problem. The only thing I would say about that is that because I can read it but it's harder to read and I rarely go without my phone, the day/date feature is probably not as important to me as I made it when I made the choice of the watch. I probably could have gotten the women's version and been happy with it.\n\nAs for this man's watch on me, I had the idea that women's watches are frumpy looking and liked the idea of a bigger watch face, but I probably would like the utilitarian look of this watch in the women's size. I just got this so will think about this overnight. When I pinch about 5 of the links out, the watch actually looks pretty good and not like I borrowed a man's watch. So, removing some links is also an option. As I said, my wrist is tiny, and so many women would not need to remove any links to make this watch fit and some might have to add links. If I removed 8 links, it would be snug on me, but I wouldn't be able to dangle it down on my hand if I had long sleeves with snug cuffs or push it up on my arm if I were doing something messy. So, I do have options: loose if I do nothing, snug if I remove 8 links, and semi-fitted if I remove only 5 links.\n\nAnd, I can use quick release silicone bands to change the look to go with different outfits. I figured out that if I got the black band, that would work for business as it almost without looking closely would come off as a black leather band. It would also have a soft, comfortable feel (based on reviews and if you get the ones that are like that so read the reviews before buying). Although I don't mind the metal expansion band and didn't notice it when I wore this for an hour on an errand, I probably would love the soft silicone bands. I'm middle aged and healthy, but if you were older or had very delicate skin for other reasons, a soft silicone band would be a great option for you. You can get soft leather bands that would feel nice, but silicone is easier to clean, can be gotten wet without staining or swelling, and is sturdy. As it is, my skin is healthy, but I have sensitive skin, not thick or rough. I can't wear pierced earrings with nickle in them. I don't think that will be an issue for this watch as it never has been for a Timex before. but I did notice that one reviewer had removed the band but left the little bars in and looped a one-piece leather band through the bars so that there was almost no skin contact with the metal. If you want to look DIY or artsy, you can even make padded fabric watchbands that have snaps to hold the watch face or use thick grosgrain ribbon to make bands to your color preference. I would even sew velvet ribbon to grosgrain ribbon or sew lace to grosgrain ribbon to make a cute band for certain casual fun outfits or a slightly dressed up event where casual touches would look cute. Because this is so inexpensive and supplies for making watch bands would be cheap due to the size needed, you could give one of these to a teen and help them come up with lots of different bands for it. You can buy band hardware (buckles, etc.) easily online.\n\nThe other thing to consider if you're very small boned is that larger watch will be heavier. My son, who is 6 feet tall and energetic, walking miles fast rather than driving, and fairly strong, also has small wrists and pointed out to me that a larger watch might feel heavy. He'd been given one years ago and took it off regularly as a result. He took it off in the orchestra room while playing his cello, and someone stole it. Having said that, this is smaller than many large-faced men's watches. It's not one of those huge watches. It covers about 2/3 of my wrist width, not all of it like many men's watches would. Although I noticed the weight when I put it on because my son advised me to consider that, it didn't bother me. With a silicone, fabric, or leather band, it would be even lighter. Heavier than most women's watches, but not as heavy as those chunky men's watches.\n\nWhen considering how practical it is to have a men's watch, I also considered size related to the small cuffed long sleeve shirts and long sleeved sweaters one might wear to work. How much of a hassle would it be to dig under my sleeve to get to the watch in a meeting? Truth is that I could wear this watch over a long sleeved thin sweater and get away with it because my clothes are so classic and practical. Also, because I live in Los Angeles where it's hot a lot and I am a woman who prefers short sleeves and jackets or cardigans to long sleeves as my main layer to avoid hot flashes, this is really not an issue for me. I also have the option of giving this watch to my son if I decide I want a smaller one and never wear it. However, I don't think he's taken the watch I gave him five years ago off since I gave it to him. So, that's all theoretical.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that this watch is a realistic purchase for a woman, even if she has small wrists. If she has very delicate skin as elderly people often do or wants it to be lighter, you can find some very nice, very inexpensive silicone watchbands that are easily cleaned and easily interchangeable with quick release pins. If she needs something breathable due to the heat, you could go with a thin leather band, a ribbon band (a thick ribbon or two layers of ribbon due to the weight and width) or a fabric band that you make or get on a crafter sales site. Or, she could wear it over a washable wrist band or a long sleeve. I personally think this is a great watch for teenage girls and boys if they would enjoy an analog watch because they can have fun with different bands.\n\nEdited to add: I slept with this watch on, but to be comfortable doing so, I put the watch over my sleeve on my long sleeved pajama top. I'm a person who doesn't like rough feeling surfaces on my skin, and so this made it comfortable to sleep in, and I didn't notice it during the night. The weight didn't bother me either. I have a feeling that silicone bands are in my near future unless I figure out a clever way to line the band with something soft. This is not a criticism of the band as it's a normal expansion band. But, I like smooth, soft surfaces next to my skin.\n\nAlso, for those who have not had the Indiglo watch face light before, the more you use it, the faster your battery dies. It's not a big deal as the battery will last long enough, but just remember that and don't give it to a kid to play with for hours unless you want to replace the battery soon.\n\nAnd, I already have enjoyed the day/date feature as I woke up wondering if it was Thursday or Friday and glance at it first thing after I turned the light on at 4:30 a.m.\n\nSome might wonder why you'd buy a watch with an expansion band if you really want something softer next to your skin. For me, this 35mm watch face was a better size than the 40 mm Weekender Unisex watch Timex sells AND it has both the day and date whereas the Weekender Unisex has neither the day nor date. You can spend upwards of $40 for the Weekender Unisex with a grosgrain ribbon band or you can buy this and then go get whatever band you want. The silicone bands I like are very well reviewed and go for less than $12 apiece, so it's about the same price to get a quick release band plus the watch at a slightly smaller size that is better for me than to buy the Weekender Unisex model that is a little too big, doesn't have the day/date, and also might not have the color I want. I like the grosgrain bands a lot as they are comfortable and you can get them in lots of colors. But, you do have to wash them regularly. To wash them, I mix a little laundry detergent in very hot water in a small container, like a cup--just about half a cup of water is fine--enough to cover. Then, let it sit for several hours in that and then rub so that all the loosened soil and oil from your skin comes off, rinse in running water while rubbing and soak again in hot water to rinse. If you have to do that regularly, it helps to have another band or another watch unless you don't mind not wearing the watch for several hours. They might be more comfortable than silicone because they breathe, but the silicone can be washed and dried within minutes. For this watch to use a slip through band like the grosgain bands you can buy or make, you need the posts and I assume but don't know that you can just use the posts provided with this band. You can also buy them to make this watch accept slip through bands.\nRead more",

                "review_text": "When my Seiko watch I had worn as an everyday watch gave up the ghost after 20 years, it was time to replace that faithful timepiece. I didn't want to spend a lot on a replacement and when I discovered that similar Seiko watches had gone up over five times the price my wife had paid for my now deceased watch, it was time to move my search for a new casual watch elsewhere. My wife suggested a casual Timex watch since I was going to wear it every day. Good suggestion.\n\nI chose this gold-tone Timex Men's 'Easy Reader' Quartz watch because I like the simple, uncluttered way it looks and also because its analogue quartz movement is easy to read. I'm getting up there in years and so simple and easy to read is important to me. I particularly like the larger black Arabic numerals, and because I am a veteran, the smaller red Arabic numeral 24-hour clock was a nice addition, too. Most of my previous watches have had a day-date calendar built into the face, so I appreciated Timex putting this feature in this new Timex watch. Another feature I didn't have on my Seiko was the nifty greenish Indiglo light that Timex included for checking the time in the dark. Just press the watch stem in and voila!, there is light. On some watches, the light will stay on until you press the stem again (or the battery dies). This Timex indiglo stays on only as long as the watch stem is pressed. I didn't see this as a problem since, in most cases, I would only be pressing the stem to find out what time it was or to read the calendar.\n\nThe case on this Timex is slightly larger than the one on my Seiko. The diameter of the Timex case is about 1 3/8\u201d (35mm). My Seiko has a gold face, gold hands, gold numerals and a gold second-hand. You can probably imagine how difficult and accurately reading the clock must have been unless there was enough light. This Timex has a gold-tone case, wristband, stem and second-hand. Like the numerals, the clock hands are also black and the watch face is a contrasting white. Even with the gold second-hand, the white face makes it so much easier for my aged eyes to quickly read the time. The watch comes with an extra long and adjustable expansion band. Unless the wrist area of your arm is quite fleshy, links will need to be removed for proper fitting. I had that done for me at a local department store that sold Timex watches; didn't take more than 10 minutes. Of course, they knew what they were doing.\n\nThe watch comes with what I thought was a small, rolled up user guide in the box. To my surprise, all it included was brief information (in eleven different languages) about the watch being water resistance, the battery and the international warranty; nothing regarding actually setting and using the watch. Okay. To get the manual, I had to download it from the Timex website using the model number to ensure I downloaded the correct manual PDF. The English version of the manual is 26 pages long; it covered everything I needed to know about this Timex watch. According to the manual, this Timex watch is both water and shock resistance (not water and shock proof!). The manual says it is \u201cwater resistant up to 30m (100 feet): in plain English, it withstands splashes or brief immersion in water, but not suitable for swimming or bathing.\u201d\n\nSetting the time and calendar was easy to do, though there was one surprise. To set the calendar day of the week (Sunday - Saturday), the clock hands had to be manually turned around and around (backwards!) until the desired day appeared in the calendar box on the watch face. That may seem easy enough unless the watch is showing Wednesday and you need it to read Saturday. That means you have to turn the hour-hand completely around the 12 on the face three or four times. That is really old school.\n\nAnother task that needs to be tended to at the end of certain months of the year is correcting the numeric date on the watch calendar. Except for Feb, Apr, Jun, Sep and Nov, all of the other months have 31 days. So, when you get to the end of one of the months with less than 31 days, a manual adjustment must be made. For example, on 1 March my watch calendar read [WED 29] because February only has 28 days in 2017. For this reason I had to advance the numeric date ahead from 29 to 1 so the watch would read [MAR 1]. Just so you also know, the stem edge is very shiny and smooth, which makes turning the stem more difficult than if the stem head was notched around the edge for grip. Once I got the calendar set, I set the watch hands according to the U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock (I did mention I was a veteran, right?). So far my new Timex watch has kept perfect time!\n\nRemember: Turn the hands \"forward\" (clockwise) to change the numerical date and turn the hands \"backwards\" to change the day of the week. If you try to do it any other way you will only frustrate yourself.\n\nUPDATE (24 March 2021): I've had this watch for four years now and it continues to keep time accurately to the minute. The Indeglo light still works fine and the watch still looks as good as new, even though I wear it often. And best of all, I have mastered adjusting the calendar!\nRead more",

Style wise, I picked this over several less appealing styles. its not totally circular, or squarish. It should be fairly easy to clean, and I usually wipe it down once a week or so. Will fit as long as your arm isnt as beefy as Popeye.\n\nSetting time in theory is simple, no instructions needed. Was a little tricky though, as I was using my phone as reference to try and set exactly. Problem is getting used to the button and which to press when. I spent a good 5min alone navigating the time setings, until I could get within 15 seconds of the phones time and finally set it.\n\nSetting the Month/Day was similar to time, but obviously easier because you arent trying to set to match down to seconds as close as possible.\n\nI do wish the indiglo backlight was a bit stronger at least. Its worthless during day time obviously. In dark, is useable, but feels too dim in my opinion. I suppose its to ensure it doesnt waste battery power, but I am not so worried about wasting power for a watch.\n\nI have not setup the alarms so have no comment on them.\n\nPrice wise, style, useablity, and compared to similar priced equivalents, its a buy\nRead more",

                "review_text": "I was looking for a sports watch that can also work great as a daily driver. Wouldn't even consider a G-Shocks, as I'm ex-military, and G-Shocks just remind me of the service. So... Ended up buying this little watch, and it really is much better than a G-Shock. Pros:\n1. The watch is 38 mm and fits perfectly on my 6.1\" wrist.\n2. Strap is comfortable.\n3. Legibility is great, large readable digits.\n4. Has 3 alarm clocks, each with a different tone.\n5. Lights keep working as long as you're pressing buttons. That means you can finish setting whatever you need, without needing to press for lights again. Lights turn off several seconds after last press.\n6. Buttons are large and comfortable.\n7. Helps me use my smartphone less, as I'm not reaching for it anymore to tell the time and set timers.\n8. Unused features can be completely turned off, so they don't clutter the interface.\n\nCons-\n1. Alarm clock is pretty loud. But I'm a deep sleeper, and I don't completely trust it to wake me up. Maybe if I set all 3 alarms consecutively, it might wake me up.\n2. Rarely, the strap pinches my arm hair.\n3. The occasion mode is pretty useless now that we have smartphones (But can be completely turned off).\n\nOverall really impressed with this watch, all the features feel really well thought out. I would highly recommend buying.\nRead more",

It's easy to read, using the buttons for run times is just a press of a button. Hit it again to get another lap or to stop it. The indigo light comes in handy at night to read the time. I'd also say it's very durable for the price. I literally beat watches up and this thing kept ticking for years and years. I only got a new once the watch band snapped.",

                "review_text": "Before I start my review of this Timex....\nA few words about Casio, because there are millions of Casio fans, many of whom won\u2019t ever admit that any non-Casio product could ever be superior in any way to a Casio.\nYes, Casio makes amazing watches (& other gadgets). I have owned several. Great company. Over the decades, the company has produced thousands of watches with remarkable features like address & appointment management, altimeter, barometer, games, moon & tide phases, GPS, compasses, atomic clock auto-setting, solar power, etc. Great products.\nBut .... if you want one amazing sport watch, nothing beats this Timex model. It has features one simply does not find on any Casio or any other digital watch brand or model. It is the perfect balance of features and simplicity with durability and comfort.\n\n1) Major Comfort.\nThis watch is amazingly comfortable for 5 reasons. It\u2019s lightweight. The band is soft silicon, not hard plastic. The band has a contour, which matches your wrist curve. The band has a lot of holes, so you can get a perfect fit. The little \u201cband keeper\u201d loop actually locks into the excess band, so the keeper won\u2019t slide around. Other sports watches have some combo of rigid plastic band, not enough holes, no locking band keeper.\n\n2) Customizable Features.\nWhat I mean by this is that you can \u201chide\u201d features from the Mode scroll-through if you aren\u2019t interested in one or more. Easy example: the watch has three alarms. I use just one. I don\u2019t plan to use the other two. I don\u2019t want to see the other two alarms as I go through the watch functions. So I set it so that I don\u2019t even see alarms 2 & 3 when I scroll through. This is a unique feature. Almost no digital watches have it. It\u2019s a great way to simplify your watch\u2019s configurations, if you like.\n\n3) Ease of Setting.\nThis watch is really intuitive to set (& to set up as I described immediately above). This is because it has 5 buttons and the screen itself shows you with labels how to \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201c the time when setting the time itself or an alarm. Amazingly straightforward. Absent on almost all other watches.\n\n4) The Features Themselves.\nWithout discussing all aspects is this watch (stopwatch, countdown timer, water resistance, etc.), I\u2019ll focus on two unique features.\n(A) The alarm is loud. Unless you are medicinally sedated or are sleeping really heavily after a 48-hour nonstop work session, it *will* wake you up.\n(B) The Indiglo light (a technology Timex introduced almost 30 years ago) is amazing for reading the display at night or in a dark room (Related: The size of the display is great too. Bold, crisp, large (even though the watch face itself is not enormous)).\n\nIf you are undecided, I\u2019d suggest reading this review and then watching a couple YouTube reviews. If you\u2019re still on the fence, just buy the watch. You\u2019ll love it. Can you get a durable & functional non-Timex for $20 or under? Yes. But go with this for the slightly higher price.\nRead more",
